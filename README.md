# Twitter Stakeholder Influencers
Finding the influencers for a set of NHS stakeholders on Twitter

Takes a list of Twitter ids in csv format and returns analysis based upon who the unifying influencers are for these individuals. #

stk_id = the id of the stakeholder
inf_id = the id of all twitter pages that a stakeholder is following

1. For each stk_id find every inf_id
2. Create tabular count of whole dataset: stk_id vs inf_id
3. Run basic analysis on most followed influencers, shortlists of all stakeholders following certain influencers, etc.
